; Notes
; Motorola S-RECORD does not support comments or strings, but any line that doesn't start with S is ignored by most compilers. For similarity with related languages, each line in this file starts with a semicolon (similar to most assembly languages, although this isn't an assembly language)

; Project language file 1
; For: SNU/2D/ProgrammingTools/IDE/S-RECORD
; About:
